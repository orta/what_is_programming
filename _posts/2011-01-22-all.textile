h1. What is Programming?
  
* A program is a way of making a computer do something.
* A programmer is a person who makes these things. But also makes it obvious how it works to someone else.

* To do that the programmer has to instruct the computer how to do something.
* Just like a recipe for making a meal.

</div><div class="slide">

h1. Why do we start programming?
  
* It's fun.
* All the cool kids are doing it.

</div><div class="slide">


h1. Aren't there better ways?

* As time progresses we get further away from what the computer wants.
* Programmers look for expressiveness in code.
* Beautiful code is readable code.

</div><div class="slide">


h1. Terminology

* Computer Program / App -> Things that run.
* Programming Language -> Things that can be ran.
* Compiler -> Things that turn code into apps.

</div><div class="slide">


h1. So what is the most basic paradigm?
* You have a computer language

* You give another program a file, or write in the code yourself. And the program just goes down line by line. We'll make a lot of these.

</div><div class="slide">

h1. Show me the code


h4(code_heading).  BASIC

{% highlight ruby %}
  
  10 PRINT "YEAH!"
  20 GOTO 10
  RUN

{% endhighlight %}

These are some simple examples

h4(code_heading).  Ruby 

{% highlight ruby %}
  
  puts "Hello World"

{% endhighlight %}

Lets jump in and see what they do.

</div><div class="slide">


h1. So what is happening here?

* In the first example
* In the second

</div><div class="slide">

h1. but but but, I want it to do something!

* On how we can do an input and an output

h4(code_heading).  Ruby 

{% highlight ruby %}
  
  puts "What would you want to eat?"
  something_nice = gets

  puts "I love"
  puts something_nice
  puts "too."

{% endhighlight %}

</div><div class="slide">

h1. So what is happening here?

* Why are there quotes around things
* what puts, and gets are
* What is a string?
  
</div><div class="slide">

h1. What is a variable
  
h4(code_heading).  Javascript 

{% highlight js %}
  
  var cheese = "brie"
  cheese
  cheese = "cheddar"
  cheese
  cheese = "wensleydale"
{% endhighlight %}

</div><div class="slide">

h1. Why are they variables useful?
  
* The official answer, to retain state.
* A better answer, so the computer can remember things, not us
* Lets make a cooking example, keeping track of how many apples we have

h4(code_heading).  Javascript 

{% highlight js %}
  
  var number_of_apples = 5
  "Oh look more apples!"
  number_of_apples = number_of_apples + 10;
  "Oh... orta ate a lot"
  number_of_apples = number_of_apples - 20;
  "wait, how do we have minus apples?"
{% endhighlight %}

or we could ask as the program is running  

h4(code_heading).  Ruby 

{% highlight ruby %}
  
  number_of_pies = 200
  puts "you have " + number_of_pies.to_s + " pies"
  puts "how many were lunched?"
  number_of_pies =  number_of_pies - gets.to_i
  puts "you now have " + number_of_pies.to_s + " pies"
{% endhighlight %}

</div><div class="slide">

h1. Methods how do they work?
  
* Methods are ways to name bits of code
* We've been using a few methods
* puts, gets, print, goto, to_s, to_i

h2. We can use and make our own methods.

</div><div class="slide">

h1. page intentionally blank

h1. Objects 
  
* The world is full of objects
* Therefore it makes sense to simulate objects

* I'm a person, I am of the same type as you, but I'm not you.

* A Person is a class, I am an instance of a class.
* An object has methods, and variables. As best to model them.

h4(code_heading).  Javascript 

{% highlight js %}
  
  var orta = { name: "orta", hair:"brown" }
  orta.do_dishes = function(){
    console.log("dishing up")
  }
  orta.do_dishes();
  orta
{% endhighlight %}

</div><div class="slide">


h1. Objects are representational

h1. ( though some can be abstract )

The simple idea is that an object can represent something.
To use the Artsy website as an example

bq.         
  Class -> Artist
  Instance -> Jason Pollock

  Or 

bq.         
  Class -> Artwork
  Instance -> Number 1

</div><div class="slide">

h1. This allows us to share code between objects, because sharing is caring.

h4(code_heading).  Ruby 

{% highlight ruby %}

  class Human
    def dance
      puts "dances!"
    end
  end

  class Nerd < Human
    def put_on_glasses
      puts "check these specs out"
    end
  end

  orta = Nerd.new
  orta.put_on_glasses()
  orta.dance()
{% endhighlight %}


</div><div class="slide">

h1. Cooking metaphors

bq. 
  Recipe -> Code
  Ingredients -> Classes
  Ingredient sliced/diced -> Instance
  Tools -> Text Editor
  You -> Compiler
